A lot of people use Linux because it is free of charge, but [for me] its true free is about freedom. The freedom of choosing which distributions as OS, which packages for each specific task...

Please keep in mind that this website is showing you only one way choosing packages according to my own preference. The ultimate purpose is to give you a first glimpse of the aforementioned "freedom", to tempt you to explore more the awesome world of Linux.
