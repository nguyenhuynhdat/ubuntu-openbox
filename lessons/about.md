Hi you all,

My name is Dat and I am from Vietnam. At first I explored Linux as a hobby but eventually, I am using Linux on everything I can now (my PC, laptop or Raspberry Pi).
I created this site for the love of Ubuntu and Openbox.
Being able to share about them with you here is pure awesomeness.
Hope you will enjoy the website and found it helpful!
Best regards,

Dat H. N.

Why Ubuntu?

I am choosing Ubuntu because it is the most recognizable name in Linux world. The target readers of this website are those have been using pre-configured Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE...) and have had a general idea of what Linux is all about. But newbies is okay too!

And it is also for those whose seek the way to install of a Operating System which contains only what they want.

That is the truly freedom I am talking about.
Why Openbox?

First and foremost: Openbox is Awesome!

And next:

To busting a bit of the myth of "how the components of your Ubuntu system working together".

Because a Windows Manager only gives you a “box” on the screen in which your program will run, you will have the space to add all the other parts of the OS on your own.

Through that experience, you can learn a lot.
