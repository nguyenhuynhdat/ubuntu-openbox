My mother once complained that the cursor on her Sony TV (connected to a PC) was a bit small for her eyes.

I know that there are cursor themes but have never bothered to look into it and have used the default cursor of Debian for years. After some searching, I found one called **Breeze**, a series of beautiful cursor theme:

![breeze cursor theme]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mousebreezegif.gif)

You can found it here:

It comes with various color patterns and sizes, for left hand and right hand:

To install a cursor theme in Openbox:

Download the theme package, decompress it into ~/.icon/ folder on your home directory.

Open **lxappearance** > **Mouse cursor** tab > find the set of **Breeze** cursor you desire > **apply**. You may need to restart your system for the change to take effect globally (system wide).
