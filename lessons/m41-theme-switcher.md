## Theme switcher
Please take a look at these screenshots of my desktop.

In case you are not agree with me that my Openbox screenshots is pretty decent, you can create another look for yours. There will be plenty space for the aesthetic sense to kick in.

In this lesson I will show you the nuts and bolts of how to configure the look of an Openbox desktop.

About composite, because my installation often has minimalism in its nature, I try to avoid any visual effect. So, the Ubuntu Openbox of this guide will not have that feature.

First, I will install themes switchers, then show you how to change taskbar theme, Openbox theme, icon theme, gtk theme, cursor theme.

### The theme swichers:

The easiest way to changing theme and icon in Openbox is using a theme switcher. They are **Lxappearance** and **Obconf**.

* Lxapperance is for changing Gtk theme, icon theme and cursor theme.

* Obconf is for changing Openbox theme.

To install them:
```
sudo apt-get install lxappearance obconf
```
