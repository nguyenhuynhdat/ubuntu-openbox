### 1. Firefox as web browser

[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
```
sudo apt-get install firefox
```
Some people may be into other browsers but I like Firefox. It is partly because I am always using it even with Windows.

Firefox has the ability to extend its default features by adding add-on. Here are some cool add-ons I always use with Firefox (just Goolge their name):

    * **Adblock plus**: block advertising on the websites you are visiting [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/)   

    * **Flashgot**: integrate downloads in Firefox with favourite download manager (more on this later with Uget) [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashgot/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashgot/)

### 2. Thunderbird as email client

Email manager help you to effective manage your email. If you are familiar with Microsoft Outlook then in Linux, a very competent alternative is Thunderbird.
```
sudo apt-get install thunderbird
```
Just add your email address and you are all set.

### 3. Transmission for torrent

Transmission gives you the ability to download from both torrent file and magnet link. I have never had any more requirement for a torrent client beyond those two feature. Transmission just get the job done for me. To install:
```
sudo apt-get install transmission
```

### 4. Uget as download manager

[http://ugetdm.com/](http://ugetdm.com/)

I used to feel that all the download managers in Linux will never be as good as **Internet Download Manager** in Windows platform but changed my mind after finding **Uget**.

**Uget** is a java based app with a modern looking interface and does the job nicely.
```
apt-get install uget
```

### 5. Dropbox for cloud storage

[https://www.dropbox.com/](https://www.dropbox.com/)

In my own experience, of all cloud storage suppliers, **Dropbox** is the nicest regarding its fluently synchronization between multiple platforms. Out of the box, it gives you 2 Gb of free space. With my usage of mainly documents, it is plenty enough.
```
sudo apt-get install dropbox
```
After installing, **Dropbox** will ask you to enter your account, create one if you have not already had one.
