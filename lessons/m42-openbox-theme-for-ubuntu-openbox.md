Mistral Theme

At the beginning of my Openbox experience, I used the default theme of Crunchbang and it still is pretty good. Now I am using a theme call **Mistral**.

The author has posted it here:

This is one of the some rare Openbox themes that I can recommend, others are often very spartan and have very few sense of modern.

In this case of Mistral, the theme is contained in a folder, but Openbox themes also come with .obt extension and can be installed using Obconf. You also can extracted that .obt package to a folder using any of compression tool.

After having the theme folder, please move it into one of these directories below. They are where Openbox will look for its theme:

* System-wide themes are installed in: **/usr/share/themes**.
* User-specific themes are in: **~/.local/share/themes** or in **~/.themes**.

Themes will be instantly registered into Obconf for you to use.

Open **Obconf** by typing the command **obconf** into terminal. Select Mistral theme.

I have to say that although it is easy, at the beginning I struggled to know all of these. Hope all the articles on this website will save you some time!
